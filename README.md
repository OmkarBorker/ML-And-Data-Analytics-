# Respository for ML tools 

## simple text summeriser
*   Utilises transformer and pipeline to generate a summary of text using NLP
*   text_sumeriser.py for reference
*   Code snippet can be used in other projects

## Heart Disease Predictor 
*   Utilises Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
*   Load the dataset into a Pandas dataframe
*   Cleans the dataset by checking for missing values and outlier and converts categorical variables such as Sex, ChestPainType, RestingECG, ExerciseAngina,       and ST_Slope into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding
*   Trained Using 1198 record of different heart paitents across India
*   Tune the model hyperparameters to optimize its performance and reduce overfitting or underfitting. Deploy the model to predict heart disease risk in new       patients and validate its accuracy on real-world data.
