# Respository for ML and Data Analytics tools


## Heart Attack Data Analytics and Prediction 
*   Utilises Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
*   Data Analytics of different parameters and correlation with Hart attack
*   Cleans the dataset by checking for missing values and outlier and converts categorical variables such as Sex, ChestPainType, RestingECG, ExerciseAngina,       and ST_Slope into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding
*   Trained Using 2666 record of different heart paitents across India
*   Tune the model hyperparameters to optimize its performance and reduce overfitting or underfitting. Deploy the model to predict heart disease risk in new       patients and validate its accuracy on real-world data.
